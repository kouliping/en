# Configuration Description

This Tutorial will guide the users to create a Virtual Machine in the Virtual Private Cloud and to make the Virtual Machine associate Elastic IP so as to realize the Virtual Machine’s access to the public network. This Tutorial is applicable to the scenario where the Virtual Machine provides outward services, such as building websites, BBS and personal blogs.

## Before Creation

- Make sure the users have registered the users' JD Cloud account and finished real-name verification.

- Make sure the users have created an Elastic IP which has not associated resources.

## Procedures

Step 1: Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

Step 2: Create a virtual machine based on VPC the users have created.

Step 3: During the creation of a Virtual Machine, the users can choose to assign an Elastic IP or no Elastic IP. This Tutorial is based on the assignment of no Elastic IP.

Step 4: Make the Virtual Machine the users have created associate Elastic IP through Virtual Machine associating Elastic IP or Elastic IP associating Virtual Machine.

## Follow-up Tests

After the Virtual Machine associates the Elastic IP, the users can test the connectivity of the Elastic IP by using Ping Elastic IP addresses.
