# Restrictions

Only JD Cloud users who successfully apply for public network IP have permission to use the Anti-DDoS Basic.

## Protective bandwidth

Anti-DDoS Basic supplies 2G attack protection capability at max. Attack on the public network IP over 2G will trigger a black hole to mask all its access.
If you need more traffic attack protection, please buy Anti-DDoS Pro.
