# Suggested fix solution for Intel processor Meltdown and Spectre security vulnerability

On January 3, 2018, Intel processor chips were found to have severe security vulnerability. The vulnerability was caused by design flaws at the hardware level of the chip, which could lead to unauthorized access to kernel sensitive data in Windows/Linux systems; for example, ordinary users of the operating system may obtain the administrator data. To prevent your virtual machine from being affected by this vulnerability, please decide whether you need to upgrade and fix the vulnerability according to your own business situation. If you need to upgrade, please refer to the following instructions and suggestions to complete the vulnerability patch of the inventory virtual machine.

(From January 9 to January 12, JD Cloud will fix the vulnerabilities in the basic architecture infrastructure of all the machine rooms in all regions as planned, which may lead to partial verification failure after patch or kernel update during this period. In such event, please try verification again after 05:00 on January 12.)

You can refer to the Microsoft and Redhat official fix solutions for system upgrade:
